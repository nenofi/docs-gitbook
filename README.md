# What is Nenofi?

Nenofi is a money market liquidity protocol built on the Optimism network. At its core, it enables users to lend and borrow any type of assets in a permissionless manner. Our unique system uses isolated pools to make lending and borrowing more flexible and secure.

## Key Features

Nenofi's distinguishing features include:

1. &#x20;**Isolated Lending Pools:**\
   Each lending pool in Nenofi operates independently, reducing the risk of bad debt accumulation and protocol contagion due to bad assets/collaterals
2. **User Empowerment:** \
   Users are able to create their own borrowing and lending pool, tailoring collateral factors and interest rate models and so on to suit their needs.
3. **Incentivized Participation (Liquidity Flywheel):** \
   More to come... ðŸ‘€ \
