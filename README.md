# What is NenoFi?

NenoFi is a decentralized applications (dApps) ecosystem that provides traditional fintech utilities and applications on-chain. Imagine a decentralized and permissionless gopay + QRIS with additional features that a traditional fintech can't do.

With NenoFi, you can make micropayments, invests in index funds, p2p permissionless lending/borrowing, savings, and so on. It is a one stop financial solution implemented in a decentralized manner.
