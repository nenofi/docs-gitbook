# Bookie

Bookie is a staking platform where users stake their neTokens at a staking pot to predict an outcome of an event. Users that are correct at predicting the outcome of an event will take everything from users that are wrong (Winner Takes All). NenoFi will take a percentage of the stake each time a staking event takes place.
