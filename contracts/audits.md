## Isolated Lending

IsolatedLendingV01 is based on Sushiswap's + BoringCrypto's KashiPair. It is made with ERC4626 standard and fixed the exchange rate logic bug, especially for liquidations ([link](https://blocksecteam.medium.com/beyond-the-market-risk-a-logic-bug-identified-in-sushiswaps-kashipairmediumriskv1-contract-80ead49d8d6d)).
