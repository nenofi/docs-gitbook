# neToken

neToken is the main token that will be used in NenoFi ecosystem. Some neTokens are an aggregation of similar tokens and some are tokens bridged from NenoBridge.&#x20;

### How neToken Aggregation Works?

Multiple similar tokens are aggregated and deposited into NenoVault, and the protocol will mint neToken based on what is being deposited.

For example:

1. Alice deposits 2 CDP stable coins (100 DAI and 100 MIM) into NenoVault.
2. Neno protocol will mint 200 neUSD to Alice.
